```
For each attribute
    For each value of the attribute, make rules as follows:
        count how often each class appears
        find the most frequent class
        make the rule assign that class to this attribute value
    Calculate the error rate of the rules 
Choose the rules with the smallest error rate 
```

### Naive-Bayes
* assumptions
  - independent attributes (that's why naive)
* simple approach, impressive results
