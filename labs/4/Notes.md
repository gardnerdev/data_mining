## Task 1 Sequential rules discovery
Dataset
* Description https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes
* Data: http://staff.ii.pw.edu.pl/~gprotazi/dydaktyka/dane/diab_trans.data

### Objective:
To find out if occurrence of hypoglycemic symptoms may be predicted based on measurements of a
level of blood glucose – to discover the best sequential rules.
All records which do not refer to the blood glucose measurement or hypoglycemic symptoms should
be discarded from the dataset. The values associated with the blood glucose measurement event
should be discretized according to information available on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level#Normal_values or
https://www.medicinenet.com/normal_blood_sugar_levels_in_adults_with_diabetes/article.htm

### A script should include:
• the way of selection the best rules
• data pre-processing, statistics and analysis
• Information about carried out experiments (parameters of a method, exemplary of rules,
evaluation of discovered rules).
• Conclusions referring to obtained results.
A way of carrying out experiments should show somehow the idea for looking for the best rules.
