### Guidelines for the report for the classification task
The general goal of the task is to build the best possible classifier based on one of the given datasets
according to the selected quality measure.
The report is a R script file that can be executed in R-Studio. The text of the report should be
included in the R file as comments. It should not be errors while executing the script.
At the beginning of the script who is the author of the scrip should be written.
The surname of the author should be included in a name of the R-script file.
### C ontent:
Aim of the experiments in which answers to the following questions should be included:
* What attribute is the class attribute and how many classes are involved in the task.
* What are the criteria for assessing the quality of the classifier?
* What is the potential practical application of the results generated by the already
constructed classifier?

### Experiments:
* A code that allows the experiment to be repeated;
* Results:
- accuracy of classification
- confusion matrix
- The values of indicators selected as criteria for assessing the quality of the classifier.
Quality assessment should be performed based on the classification of test data

### Conclusions
* should be based on reported experiments;
* should be non-trivial (e.g. an indication of which experiment and for which parameters the
best result was obtained is not enough).
