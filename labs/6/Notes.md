## Classification
Classification is a process of assigining a given object to a certain 
class (croup) from predefined set of classes
- typically only one class is assigned

Classification in data mining areas refers to the methods 
of automatic building of classifiers based on training 
data including labelled objects.

The purpose of the classification is to find rule (rules)
which gives for any object 'w' its class c.

### Evaluation of classification quality
* precision
* recall
* accuracy
* error


### Decision tree problems
* how to partition the data at each step?
* when to stop partitioning?
* how to predict the value of a class/category for each object in a partition?
